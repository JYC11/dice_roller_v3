# YdX +/- modifier - STD
# advantage and disadvantage - ADV/DADV
# multiple of YdX rolls eg: 3x1d20+5 - MTP
# YdX drop lowest - DROPMIN
# YdX drop highest - DROPMAX
# rolls succeeding a threshold eg: 20x1d20+5>14 - THR
# average of many rolls - AVG
# maximum of many rolls - MAX
# minumum of many rolls - MIN

# features needed
# REPL loop
# compiler
# random number generator
# min max number finder
# remove element from array
# sum up rolls into total
# print rolls
