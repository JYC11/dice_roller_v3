# DICE ROLLER V3: OVERENGINEERED TO HELL

I read Architecture Patterns with Python and got inspired so I decided to overengineer the heck out of my favourite side-project: A dice roller.

I can't exactly implement everything I read in the book at work because deadlines and legacy code so the next best thing is doing this.

# TODO:

1. once everything is done, do a branch that replaces the entrypoint from repl to fastapi
2. same as above with flask
